; Welcome to MasterMind.  This version has a graphical output and a textual input.
; The shell was written by Dr. Browning February 10, 2014.
;  There are two functions that the student needs to write to complete this project:
;  First, write the code to determine the correct score for a guess.
;  Second, write the code to create a random pattern for the game.

; Set up the initial frame for the output display
(define frame (new frame%
                   [label "MasterMind"]
                   [width 460]

; Show the available colors in a white band at the top of the display

(define mycolors '("red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "SkyBlue" "blue" "purple" "brown"))

(define (display-colors dc)
  (send dc set-pen "black" 1 'solid )  
  (for ([i (in-range 8)])          ; display each of the eight colors
    (begin (send dc set-brush (get-item (+ i 1) mycolors) 'solid)
           (send dc draw-ellipse (+ 12.5 (* 15 i)) 5 10 10))))

(define (show-colors)
  (new canvas% [parent frame]  ;create a canvas in the frame
     [min-height 50]
       [paint-callback
        (lambda (canvas ac)
          (send ac set-background  "white") ;sets background to white
          (send ac clear)          ;causes new background color to appear
          (send ac set-scale 3 3)  ;makes the dots bigger by a factor of 3
          (display-colors ac)
          )]))

; Set up the secret code
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Assignment 2 :  Make this a random secret code
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(define pattern '("red" "purple" "red" "yellow" "red"))

; Helper function.  Returns the ith item from mylist
; NOT ROBUST. This assumes i is less than or equal to length of mylist
(define (get-item i mylist)
    (if (= i 1)
        (car mylist)
        (get-item (- i 1) (cdr mylist))))

; Display the five colors of the guess and then the black and white pegs for the score
(define (display-myline dc roundguess rectscore) 
  (send dc set-pen "black" 1 'solid )   
  (for ([i (in-range 5)])                        ; display guess

                      (send dc draw-ellipse (+ 5 (* 15 i)) 5 10 10)))
  (send dc set-pen "tan" 1 'solid ) 
  (for ([i (in-range 5)])                        ; display score
    (begin(send dc set-brush (get-item (+ i 1) rectscore) 'solid)
                    (send dc draw-rectangle (+ 95 (* 10 i)) 5 6 9))))

; This is the function that we call to add a line to the display
(define (addaline guessin responsein)
  (new canvas% [parent frame]  ;create a canvas in the frame
     [min-height 50]
       [paint-callback

; Assignment 1:  Return the correct string for a score.

; Return a list of length 5 starting with a "black" entry for
; each time an element of mycode matches the element of myguess in the same position.
; The returned list then contains a "white" entry for each time an element of myguess
; also occurs in mycode (ignoring all items previously matched).
; The returned list then contains "tan" entries as needed to fill out the five entries.
